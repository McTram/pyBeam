Remark # 1
NMULTIFREEDOM can hanle ONLY linear constrains of the type Ai*Ui + Bj*Uj +...=assigned value   (no sum on repeated indices)
For example, a multifreedom constraint could be 3*U1 + 4*U21 + 7*U215 + ... = 34 
where U1 could be for example the U component of the displacement of node 1, U21 could be the W component of the 
displacement of node 4, U212 could be the V component of the displacement of node 36 and so on. 

Remark # 2
The multifreedom constraint can be reduced to a constraint of the type Uj=0 which means that the displacement Uj cannot 
take place. For example, if a node cannot move in the z direction then it is stated 
U3 = 0 

Remark # 3
The multifreedom constraint is enforced by using the penalty method (see discussion taken from Felippa and reported 
in my notes on the nonlinear springs at page 3). 

Remark # 4
The multifreedom constraint requires the use of a penalty number which should be used according to Felippa suggestions
(see page 3 of my notes). The formula that will be adopted is the following: the highest term on the diagonal of the tangent 
stiffness matrix will be multiplied by PENALTY = STIFFNESS * 10^IPENALTY. By default it is used IPENALTY = 8 so the penalty term will be 10^8 times 
the highest term of the tangent stiffness matrix. The user can change this number at will. Please make sure that the number is not 
too small or not too large. If too small the boundary condition is not well imposed. If it is too large ill conditioning may appear. 
See Felippa's recommendations. 

Remark # 5
Linear and nonlinear springs are assigned with the same input files. It is responsibility of the user to make sure the correct 
representation of the springs is given.

Remark # 6 
A multifreedom constraint of the type Uj = 0 could also be imposed with a spring with very high stiffness. This can be done 
because at the end both methods are equivalent to a penalty approach! This is true if the very high stiffness is ways higher than the 
highest stiffness in the tangent matrix. Please note that this value cannot be too high to avoid ill conditioning.     

Remark # 7
In this code the law used for the definitions of all the spring is polynomial. It is decided that each spring can depend on 
all possible degrees of freedom as follows: 
K = K0 + A1*U1^1 + A2*U1^2 + A3*U1^3+...+ B1*U2^1 + B2*U2^2 + B3*U2^3+...+ C1*U3^1 + C2*U3^2 + C3*U3^2 and so on. 
Other laws could be easily implemented (please see the theory on the document "nonlinearsprings" at page 6).

Remark # 8
The law used to define the spring can change and have a piecewise description (example: free play case in which the stiffness 
is defined in 3 different intervals for the displacement variable). 
In the file SPRINGS_ISTDYN21.STR the law used for the different intervals of the displacement variables will be defined. 
The specification of the intervals may involve only one of the degrees of freedom 
(i.e., the law describing how the spring stiffness changes is different if for example 
U1 is negative or positive).  The piecewise description can be assigned 
only by considering a single variable (see the theory) which is a priori selected by the user.

Remark # 9
The spring parameters are defined in the file SPRINGS_ISTDYN21.STR. 

Remark # 10
The number of springs could be selected to be zero. In that case no file will be read. 

Remark # 11
The code first changes the tangent stiffness matrix and unbalanced load because of the presence of the springs.
Second the code imposes all the multifreedom constraints. 

Remark # 12
The multifreedom constraints are read from the file MULTIFREEDOM_ISTDYN21.STR
The number of multifreedom constraints could be selected to be zero. In that case no file will be read.
