The material ID will be the row ID. So the material number 1 will be the first and so on.
Notice that the material properties are given in the material axes (orthotropic material). 
Notice also that NU21 = NU12 * E22/E11.
RHO is the density of the material and it is used for the free vibration problem. In the case of ISTDYN= 2 it is not used.
